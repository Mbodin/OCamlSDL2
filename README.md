## Intro

OCamlSDL2 is an OCaml interface to the SDL2 library.

If you are searching for OCaml bindings for SDL 1.2
then you should go there instead:
  [ocamlsdl.sf.net](
  http://ocamlsdl.sourceforge.net/)

## FAQ

Why another OCaml SDL bindings?

SDL1 was released under the LGPL and OCamlSDL1 too.
(LGPL without any exception on static linking.)
SDL2 is released under a liberal license. And it was
impossible to reach the authors of OCamlSDL1 to ask
them to change the license.
If SDL changes again its license in the future to any
Floss / OSI approved license, you can use these
bindings under the terms of the same license.


## Versions

This version of the bindings is known to work with
SDL 2.0.9 and OCaml 4.07.1
