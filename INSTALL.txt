=== Linux, Cygwin, and OSX ===

Under an Unix-like system, go in the directory src/
and create a file named "Makefile.config" based on
"Makefile.config.win32" or "Makefile.config.unix".

Then you can run:
$ make gen
$ make dep
$ make opt byte

----------------

If you want to use the module 'Sdlsurface_ba' which uses ocaml bigarrays
you also have to run these targets:
$ make ba
$ make baopt

----------------

If you compiled and installed SDL2 with
./configure --prefix=/tmp/SDL2-temp
then you need to make sure that the utility "sdl2-config"
can be found in the path:

$ export PATH="$PATH:/tmp/SDL2-temp/bin"

----------------

After the compilation, complete the installation with:
$ make install

By default the installation will be done in the directory:
  DESTDIR="`ocamlc -where`/sdl2"
you can install in another directory with:
$ make install DESTDIR="/tmp/mysdl2"

----------------

If you wish to install the accompanying libraries then
you should install the C headers of the stubs with:
$ make install_h
or
$ make findinstall_h

----------------

Install using ocamlfind:
$ make findinstall

----------------

To uninstall:
$ make uninstall
or
$ make finduninstall
