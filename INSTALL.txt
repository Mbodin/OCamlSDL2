=== Linux and Cygwin ===

Under Linux and Cygwin, go in the directory src/
and create a file named "Makefile.config" based on
"Makefile.config.cygwin" or "Makefile.config.linux".

Then you can run:
$ make gen
$ make dep
$ make opt byte

----------------

If you compiled and installed SDL2 with
./configure --prefix=/tmp/SDL2-temp
then you need to make sure that the utility "sdl2-config"
can be found in the path:

$ export PATH="$PATH:/tmp/SDL2-temp/bin"

----------------


=== Other Environments ===

Please tell me how to do in other environments.
